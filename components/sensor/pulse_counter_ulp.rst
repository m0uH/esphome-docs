    :description: Instructions for setting up pulse counter ULP sensors.
    :image: pulse.svg

The pulse counter ULP sensor allows you to count the number of pulses and the frequency of a signal
on a RTC_GPIO pin.

This sensor uses the ESP32's Ultra-Low Power (ULP) processor, which remains
active even in :doc:`deep sleep </components/deep_sleep>`. Only one ULP
component can run at a time.

This sensor is only available on the ESP32 using the IDF framework.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: pulse_counter_ulp
        pin: GPIOXX
        name: "Pulse Counter ULP"

Configuration variables
-----------------------

- **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The pin to count pulses on. This must be a valid RTC_GPIO pin.
- **count_mode** (*Optional*): Configure how the counter should behave
  on a detected rising edge/falling edge.

  - **rising_edge** (*Optional*): What to do when a rising edge is
    detected. One of ``DISABLE``, ``INCREMENT`` and ``DECREMENT``.
    Defaults to ``INCREMENT``.
  - **falling_edge** (*Optional*): What to do when a falling edge is
    detected. One of ``DISABLE``, ``INCREMENT`` and ``DECREMENT``.
    Defaults to ``DISABLE``.

- **sleep_duration** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): How long the ULP program
  will sleep for between reads. Higher values will reduce battery consumption at
  the cost of missing shorter pulses. The shortest pulse that can be measured has
  a width of ``sleep_duration * (debounce + 1)``. Defaults to ``20ms``.
- **debounce** (*Optional*, int): Number of consecutive high or low inputs the
  ULP program needs to see to change state. Higher values will reduce the chance
  for false positives at the cost of missing shorter pulses. The shortest pulse
  that can be measured has a width of ``sleep_duration * (debounce + 1)``.
  Defaults to ``3``.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check
  the sensor while awake. The sensor will not update while in deep sleep, but will
  update on wake regardless of ``update_interval``. Defaults to ``60s``.
- **edges_wakeup** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): After detecting the specified 
  number of pulses while being asleep, the main SoC will be woken up.
  A number of ``0`` is disables the feature and the main SoC will only awake
  after the configured wakeup time.
- **enable_pin** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): A GPIO pin to be enabled before 
  reading the pulse state. The pin must be a valid RTCIO pin.
- **enable_time** (*Optional, :ref:`config-time`): The delay ``enable_pin`` shall be
  switched on before reading the pulses. Must be a multiple of ``0.5ms``.
  Defaults to ``0ms`` (no delay).
- **total** (*Optional*): Report the total number of pulses counted since the last reset.
- All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

.. note::

    Pulse Counter ULP keeps time between reads by counting how many times the
    ULP program runs. This count is stored in a ``uint16_t``. Accounting for
    potential time between the last read and the start of deep sleep, the
    recommended maximum deep sleep duration is
    ``sleep_duration * 65535 - update_interval``.

    For the default values, this is just over 20 minutes.

    The counting of total pulses is not impacted by this limitation.
    If the rate sensor is not of interest, longer sleep times can be used,
    but the rate sensor will report invalid values.

.. note::

    See :doc:`integration sensor </components/sensor/integration>` for summing up pulse counter ULP
    values over time.

Converting units
----------------

The sensor defaults to measuring its values using a unit of measurement
of “pulses/min”. You can change this by using :ref:`sensor-filters`.
For example, if you're using the pulse counter with a photodiode to
count the light pulses on a power meter, you can do the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: pulse_counter_ulp
        pin: GPIOXX
        unit_of_measurement: 'kW'
        name: 'Power Meter House'
        filters:
          - multiply: 0.06  # (60s/1000 pulses per kWh)

Counting total pulses
---------------------

When the total sensor is configured, the pulse_counter also reports the total
number of pulses measured since the last reset. When used on a power meter,
this can be used to measure the total consumed energy in kWh since the last reset.

Using the total pulses is less error-prone in case of instable communication.
Keep in mind that establishing a WiFi connection might take some time to be
available again after deep sleep.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: pulse_counter_ulp
        pin: GPIOXX
        unit_of_measurement: 'kW'
        name: 'Power Meter House'
        filters:
          - multiply: 0.06  # (60s/1000 pulses per kWh)

        total:
          unit_of_measurement: 'kWh'
          name: 'Energy Meter House'
          filters:
            - multiply: 0.001  # (1/1000 pulses per kWh)

Switching the pulse generator
-----------------------------
Via `enable_pin` an active pulse generator can be switched on and off for reading the pulse state.

This allows disabling the pulse generator while not reading the pulse state to lower power consumption.

E.g. in case an LED is used to detect a higher reflecting surface, the LED and sensor module can
be turned off while not reading the sensor state.


.. note::
    Using a water meter as example:

    Maximal flow rate is ``2.5m³/h`` and a pulse is generated every ``0.5L``. This means the pulse state needs
    to be checked at a frequency of ``5Hz``. This allows turning on the LED only once every ``200ms``.
    Turning on the LED and sensor module only once every ``200ms`` results in a drastically lower power consumption.

    In case the sensor module needs a current of 3mA, the power consumption drops in this example
    from ``3mAh`` to ``1ms * 3mA + 0.01mA * 199ms = 0.016mAh``.

Wiring
------

If you want to count pulses from a simple reed switch, the simplest way is to make
use of the internal pull-up/pull-down resistors.

You can wire the switch between a GPIO pin and GND; in this case set the pin to input, pullup and inverted:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Reed switch between GPIO and GND
    sensor:
      - platform: pulse_counter_ulp
        pin:
          number: 12
          inverted: true
          mode:
            input: true
            pullup: true
        name: "Pulse Counter ULP"

If you wire it between a GPIO pin and +3.3V, set the pin to input, pulldown:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Reed switch between GPIO and +3.3V
    sensor:
      - platform: pulse_counter_ulp
        pin:
          number: 12
          mode:
            input: true
            pulldown: true
        name: "Pulse Counter ULP"

The safest way is to use GPIO + GND, as this avoids the possibility of short
circuiting the wire by mistake.
